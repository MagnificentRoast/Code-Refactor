CODE REFACTORING CHALLENGE

Goal: Refactor the code to make it adhere to accessibility standards, and increase Search Engine Optimization.

While the code was functional, there are a lot of div tags present, the goal is to change things so everything is functional and easy to read, while meeting accessibility standards.

The "search engine optimization" navigation link was broken when the code was received, that was fixed.

You can find the header, aside, footer, and section tags already there if you view the source code. More will be changed and more will be shown in this readme as the fixes are being deployed.
